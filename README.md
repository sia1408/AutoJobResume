# AutoJobResume
I will use LLM GPT-3, python for pull requests, streamlit to preview it. Next steps: Will add web scraping to get key info from websites of companies and use that in resume, will train model on 'exceptional' resumes for targeted results, and will fully automate it so that only based on your own resume, the model will apply to companies on its own.
